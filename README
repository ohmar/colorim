This package of scripts will get the most dominant colors in an image and create
a beautiful colorscheme. In this case, the colorscheme is exported into an
.Xresources file. This file is used in many programs to define terminal colours,
configure terminal preferences, set DPI, antialiasing, hinting, other X font settings,
and many other configurations.

The html file will also show you which colors were chosen and also a thumbnail
of your given image. Your image should lie in the same directory as these two
scripts. No configuration necessary.

There are a few dependencies for both of these programs to run successfully.

For colorz.py, the PIL module is needed. It can be installed with the 
following commands:
		Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python-imaging
		Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S python-imaging
		Fedora: sudo yum install python-imaging

For the colxres.py program, the following are required dependencides; urxvt and 
urxvt-perls. They can installed with the 
following commands:
		Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install rxvt-unicode
		Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S rxvt-unicode urxvt-perls
		Fedora: sudo yum install rxvt-unicode
